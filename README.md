### 🚀 Professional Snapshot

Full‑stack Lead Developer with 13+ years designing and shipping scalable cloud and web platforms. I specialize in:
- Building reusable developer platforms and internal packages (Node.js + React ecosystems)
- Architecting event‑driven & microservice solutions on AWS (Lambda, Fargate, Step Functions, EventBridge)
- Identity & Access Management (Keycloak, Gigya / SAP CDC, OAuth2, OIDC, SAML) and SSO architectures
- High‑quality API layers (REST + GraphQL) with contract/version discipline
- Enabling engineering teams: mentoring, code review standards, CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines)
- Integrating AI/automation: documentation ingestion & model input pipelines

I thrive at the intersection of architecture depth, developer experience, and delivery discipline.
